```{r Longevity}
anyNA(longevity.df)
ggAcf(longevity.df,24)
longevity.ts=ts(longevity.df,start =c(1970,1),frequency = 1)
long.ts=ts(cbind(longevity.ts,t=seq(from=1,to=length(longevity.ts)),start=c(1970,1)))
```
There is a definite trend in the data. no seasonal pattarns though.also only one varaible for long so we will be using length instead of nrows for partitioning. converted to ts object.cbinded a t variable for a time stamp.

```{r , echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
